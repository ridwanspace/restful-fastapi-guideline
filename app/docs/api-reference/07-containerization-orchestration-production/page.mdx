## 21. Containerization and Orchestration for Production

Containerization (primarily with Docker) and orchestration (commonly with Kubernetes) are foundational for deploying, scaling, and managing modern applications, including FastAPI services, in production.

### Introduction to Containerization

**What are Containers?**
Containers are a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings. Docker is the most popular containerization platform.

**Benefits:**
*   **Consistency:** Applications run the same way regardless of where they are deployed (developer's laptop, testing, production).
*   **Portability:** Build once, run anywhere that supports containers.
*   **Isolation:** Containers isolate applications from each other and the underlying system.
*   **Efficiency:** Lighter than traditional virtual machines, allowing for better resource utilization.
*   **Scalability:** Easy to scale applications up or down by running more or fewer container instances.
*   **DevOps Enablement:** Streamlines CI/CD pipelines and improves collaboration between development and operations.

### Dockerizing FastAPI Applications

To containerize your FastAPI application, you create a `Dockerfile`. This text file contains instructions for Docker to build an image.

**Key `Dockerfile` Instructions:**
*   **`FROM`:** Specifies the base image (e.g., an official Python image).
*   **`WORKDIR`:** Sets the working directory for subsequent instructions.
*   **`COPY` or `ADD`:** Copies files from your local machine into the image.
*   **`RUN`:** Executes commands during the image build process (e.g., installing dependencies).
*   **`EXPOSE`:** Informs Docker that the container listens on specified network ports at runtime (documentation purposes, doesn't actually publish the port).
*   **`ENV`:** Sets environment variables.
*   **`CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT`:** Specifies the command to run when the container starts. For FastAPI, this is typically `uvicorn`.

**Basic `Dockerfile` Example for FastAPI:**
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile

# 1. Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.10-slim-buster AS base

# 2. Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1  # Prevents python from writing .pyc files
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1      # Force stdin, stdout, stderr to be totally unbuffered

# 3. Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# 4. Install system dependencies if any (less common for simple FastAPI, but good to know)
# RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends some-package && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# 5. Copy the requirements file into the container at /app
COPY ./requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt

# 6. Install Python dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pip
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# 7. Copy the rest of the application code into the container at /app
COPY . /app/

# 8. Expose the port the app runs on (e.g., 8000 for Uvicorn default)
EXPOSE 8000

# 9. Define the command to run your app using Uvicorn
#    Host 0.0.0.0 makes it accessible from outside the container.
#    Workers can be configured based on CPU cores.
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000", "--workers", "2"]
```
**`requirements.txt` example:**
```
fastapi
uvicorn[standard] # Includes gunicorn, ujson, etc.
pydantic
# Add other dependencies here
```
**`.dockerignore` file (place in the same directory as Dockerfile):**
```
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
.Python
env/
venv/
.git/
.gitignore
Dockerfile
docker-compose.yml
README.md
# Add other files/directories you don't want in the image
```
**Build and Run:**
```bash
docker build -t my-fastapi-app .
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name my-running-app my-fastapi-app
```

### Multi-stage Builds

Multi-stage builds allow you to use multiple `FROM` instructions in your `Dockerfile`. Each `FROM` instruction can use a different base, and each begins a new stage of the build. You can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another, leaving behind everything you don't want in the final image.

**Benefits:**
*   **Smaller Final Images:** By discarding build tools, intermediate files, and development dependencies.
*   **Improved Security:** Reduces the attack surface by not including unnecessary tools or libraries in the production image.
*   **Better Build Cache Utilization:** Changes in one stage might not invalidate caches for other stages.

**Example `Dockerfile` with Multi-stage Build:**
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile (Multi-stage)

# ---- Build Stage ----
FROM python:3.10-slim-buster AS builder

ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1

WORKDIR /opt/app_build

# Install build-time dependencies (if any, e.g., for compiling C extensions)
# RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends build-essential libpq-dev

COPY ./requirements.txt .

# Install dependencies into a virtual environment within the build stage
RUN python -m venv /opt/venv
ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH" # Activate venv for subsequent RUN commands
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pip
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt


# ---- Runtime Stage ----
FROM python:3.10-slim-buster AS runtime

ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1
ENV APP_HOME=/app

WORKDIR $APP_HOME

# Create a non-root user and group
RUN groupadd -r appuser && useradd --no-log-init -r -g appuser appuser

# Copy only the virtual environment from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /opt/venv /opt/venv

# Copy application code
COPY . $APP_HOME/

# Ensure the appuser owns the application files and venv
RUN chown -R appuser:appuser $APP_HOME /opt/venv

# Switch to the non-root user
USER appuser

# Make port 8000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 8000

# Activate the virtual environment and run the application
ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

### Introduction to Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file (`docker-compose.yml`) to configure your application's services, networks, and volumes.

**Use Cases:**
*   **Local Development:** Easily spin up your FastAPI app along with dependencies like databases (PostgreSQL, Redis), message brokers, etc.
*   **Testing:** Create isolated environments for integration testing.
*   **Simple Multi-service Deployments:** For smaller applications, though Kubernetes is preferred for complex production scenarios.

**Basic `docker-compose.yml` Structure:**
```yaml
# version: "3.8" # Specify Compose file version

# services:
#   web: # Your FastAPI application service
#     build: . # Build from Dockerfile in the current directory
#     # image: your-dockerhub-username/my-fastapi-app:latest # Or use a pre-built image
#     container_name: fastapi_web_app
#     command: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload # Command for development
#     volumes:
#       - .:/app # Mount current directory to /app in container for live code reloading
#     ports:
#       - "8000:8000" # Map host port 8000 to container port 8000
#     environment:
#       - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@db:5432/mydatabase
#       - REDIS_URL=redis://cache:6379
#       # Add other environment variables
#     depends_on: # Ensure db and cache start before the web app (for startup order, not readiness)
#       - db
#       - cache

#   db: # PostgreSQL database service
#     image: postgres:15-alpine
#     container_name: postgres_db
#     volumes:
#       - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/ # Persist database data
#     environment:
#       - POSTGRES_USER=user
#       - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
#       - POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase
#     ports:
#       - "5432:5432" # Expose DB port if needed for direct access from host

#   cache: # Redis cache service
#     image: redis:7-alpine
#     container_name: redis_cache
#     ports:
#       - "6379:6379"

# volumes: # Define named volumes for data persistence
#   postgres_data:
```
**Run with Docker Compose:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d # Start services in detached mode
docker-compose down    # Stop and remove containers, networks
docker-compose logs -f web # Follow logs for the 'web' service
```

### Basic Concepts of Kubernetes Deployment

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It's the de-facto standard for container orchestration in production.

**Key Kubernetes Objects:**
*   **Pod:** The smallest deployable unit. A Pod represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster and can contain one or more containers (like your FastAPI app container). Containers within a Pod share network and storage resources.
*   **Deployment:** Describes the desired state for your application. It manages a set of replica Pods and handles rolling updates and rollbacks. If a Pod crashes, the Deployment will automatically create a new one.
*   **Service:** Provides a stable network endpoint (a single IP address and DNS name) to access a set of Pods. It acts as a load balancer for the Pods it targets (selected via labels). Types include `ClusterIP` (internal), `NodePort`, `LoadBalancer` (cloud provider), and `ExternalName`.
*   **Ingress:** Manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP/S. It can provide load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting. An Ingress controller (e.g., Nginx Ingress, Traefik) is needed to fulfill the Ingress rules.
*   **ConfigMap & Secret:** Used to manage application configuration and sensitive data (like API keys, passwords) respectively, decoupling them from your container images.
*   **Namespace:** Provides a scope for names. Used to create virtual clusters within a physical cluster.

**Conceptual YAML Manifests for a FastAPI App:**

**1. `deployment.yaml`:**
```yaml
# apiVersion: apps/v1
# kind: Deployment
# metadata:
#   name: fastapi-app-deployment
#   labels:
#     app: fastapi-app
# spec:
#   replicas: 3 # Number of desired Pods
#   selector:
#     matchLabels:
#       app: fastapi-app # Selects Pods with this label
#   template: # Pod template
#     metadata:
#       labels:
#         app: fastapi-app
#     spec:
#       containers:
#       - name: fastapi-container
#         image: your-dockerhub-username/my-fastapi-app:latest # Your Docker image
#         ports:
#         - containerPort: 8000 # Port your app listens on inside the container
#         env:
#           - name: DATABASE_URL
#             valueFrom:
#               secretKeyRef:
#                 name: app-secrets
#                 key: db_url
#         # resources: # Optional: Define CPU/memory requests and limits
#         #   requests:
#         #     memory: "128Mi"
#         #     cpu: "250m" # 0.25 CPU core
#         #   limits:
#         #     memory: "256Mi"
#         #     cpu: "500m"
#         # livenessProbe: ... (see next section)
#         # readinessProbe: ... (see next section)
```

**2. `service.yaml`:**
```yaml
# apiVersion: v1
# kind: Service
# metadata:
#   name: fastapi-app-service
# spec:
#   type: LoadBalancer # Or ClusterIP for internal, NodePort for specific node port
#   selector:
#     app: fastapi-app # Selects Pods managed by the Deployment above
#   ports:
#   - protocol: TCP
#     port: 80       # Port the Service is available on
#     targetPort: 8000 # Port on the Pods/containers to forward traffic to
```

**3. `ingress.yaml` (Optional, for external access via domain name):**
```yaml
# apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
# kind: Ingress
# metadata:
#   name: fastapi-app-ingress
#   # annotations:
#   #   kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "nginx" # Example for Nginx Ingress controller
#   #   cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod" # For automatic SSL with cert-manager
# spec:
#   rules:
#   - host: api.yourdomain.com
#     http:
#       paths:
#       - path: /
#         pathType: Prefix
#         backend:
#           service:
#             name: fastapi-app-service # Name of the Service defined above
#             port:
#               number: 80 # Port of the Service
  # tls: # Optional: For HTTPS
  # - hosts:
  #   - api.yourdomain.com
  #   secretName: yourdomain-tls-secret # Kubernetes secret containing TLS cert and key
```
**Apply to Kubernetes:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
# kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml # If using Ingress
```

### Health Checks for Containerized Applications

Health checks are critical for orchestrators like Kubernetes to manage your application's lifecycle effectively.
*   **Liveness Probe:** Kubernetes uses liveness probes to know when to restart a container. If a liveness probe fails, Kubernetes kills the container and restarts it according to its restart policy.
*   **Readiness Probe:** Kubernetes uses readiness probes to know when a container is ready to start accepting traffic. A Pod is considered ready when all of its containers are ready. If a readiness probe fails, Kubernetes removes the Pod's IP address from the endpoints of all Services that match the Pod.

**Implementing Health Check Endpoints in FastAPI:**
```python
# In your main.py or a dedicated health_check_router.py

from fastapi import FastAPI, APIRouter, status, Response

# app = FastAPI() # Assuming app is defined elsewhere if this is a separate router file
health_router = APIRouter(tags=["Health Checks"])

# Basic liveness check - is the app process running?
@health_router.get("/health/live", status_code=status.HTTP_200_OK)
async def liveness_check():
    return {"status": "alive"}

# Readiness check - is the app ready to serve traffic?
# This might involve checking database connections, cache, other dependencies.
@health_router.get("/health/ready", status_code=status.HTTP_200_OK)
async def readiness_check():
    # Simulate checking dependencies
    db_ready = True # await check_db_connection()
    cache_ready = True # await check_cache_connection()

    if db_ready and cache_ready:
        return {"status": "ready", "dependencies": {"database": "ok", "cache": "ok"}}
    else:
        # Return 503 if not ready, so Kubernetes doesn't send traffic
        # This requires careful implementation to avoid flapping if checks are unreliable.
        # For simplicity, we'll return 200 but indicate not ready in payload.
        # A better approach for K8s is to actually return 503 if not ready.
        # raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_503_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE, detail="Service not ready")
        return Response(
            content=json.dumps({"status": "not_ready", "dependencies": {"database": "error" if not db_ready else "ok", "cache": "error" if not cache_ready else "ok"}}),
            status_code=status.HTTP_503_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE, # Correct for K8s
            media_type="application/json"
        )


# app.include_router(health_router) # Add to your main FastAPI app
```

**Configuring Probes in Kubernetes Deployment (`deployment.yaml` snippet):**
```yaml
# ... (inside spec.template.spec.containers[])
#       containers:
#       - name: fastapi-container
#         # ... other container config ...
#         livenessProbe:
#           httpGet:
#             path: /health/live # Your liveness endpoint
#             port: 8000
#           initialDelaySeconds: 15 # Wait before first probe
#           periodSeconds: 20    # How often to probe
#           timeoutSeconds: 5
#           failureThreshold: 3
#         readinessProbe:
#           httpGet:
#             path: /health/ready # Your readiness endpoint
#             port: 8000
#           initialDelaySeconds: 20 # Often longer than liveness
#           periodSeconds: 10
#           timeoutSeconds: 5
#           successThreshold: 1
#           failureThreshold: 3
```
Properly configured health checks ensure that your application is resilient and that traffic is only routed to healthy, ready instances.
