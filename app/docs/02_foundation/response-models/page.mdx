# Response Models

Using `response_model` in your path operation decorators ensures that the response data conforms to a specific Pydantic model, filtering out any extra data. This is good for security and predictability.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional

app = FastAPI()

class UserIn(BaseModel):
    username: str
    password: str
    email: str
    full_name: Optional[str] = None

class UserOut(BaseModel): # This is our response model
    username: str
    email: str
    full_name: Optional[str] = None

@app.post("/users/", response_model=UserOut)
async def create_user(user: UserIn):
    # In a real app, you would save the user to a database
    # The password will not be returned because it's not in UserOut
    return user 
```
Even though `UserIn` includes a password, the `/users/` endpoint will only return fields defined in `UserOut`.
