# Basic API Versioning (URL-based)

A simple way to version your API is by including the version in the URL.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, APIRouter

app = FastAPI()

router_v1 = APIRouter(prefix="/api/v1")

@router_v1.get("/greet")
async def greet_v1():
    return {"message": "Hello from API v1"}

app.include_router(router_v1)

# You could define a router_v2 for a future version
# router_v2 = APIRouter(prefix="/api/v2")
# @router_v2.get("/greet")
# async def greet_v2():
#     return {"message": "Hello from API v2 with new features!"}
# app.include_router(router_v2)
```
Clients would then access `/api/v1/greet`.
