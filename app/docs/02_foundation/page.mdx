# Foundation

Welcome to the Foundation section! This comprehensive guide builds upon the "Getting Started" section and introduces essential concepts for building production-ready RESTful APIs with FastAPI.

## Overview

This section provides a structured learning path covering the fundamental concepts you need to master for building robust, maintainable, and scalable APIs:

### [1. Introduction to RESTful API Concepts](/docs/foundation/01-introduction)
Understand the core principles of REST architecture and how FastAPI implements them effectively.

### [2. Request Handling](/docs/foundation/02-request-handling)
Master path parameters, query parameters, request bodies, and headers to handle diverse client requests.

### [3. Data Validation](/docs/foundation/03-data-validation)
Learn how to leverage Pydantic models for automatic data validation, serialization, and documentation.

### [4. Response Handling](/docs/foundation/04-response-handling)
Control your API responses with response models, status codes, and custom headers for predictable behavior.

### [5. Error Handling](/docs/foundation/05-error-handling)
Implement comprehensive error handling strategies with custom exceptions and consistent error responses.

### [6. API Versioning](/docs/foundation/06-api-versioning)
Explore different versioning strategies to maintain backward compatibility as your API evolves.

### [7. Project Structure](/docs/foundation/07-project-structure)
Organize your FastAPI project for scalability with proper file structure and modular design patterns.

### [8. Testing Basics](/docs/foundation/08-testing-basics)
Write tests for your API endpoints to ensure reliability and catch issues early in development.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this section, ensure you've completed the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide, which covers:
- FastAPI installation and setup
- Basic HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- RESTful URI design principles
- Creating your first API endpoints

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you'll be able to:
- ✅ Design RESTful APIs following industry best practices
- ✅ Handle complex request scenarios with path, query, and body parameters
- ✅ Implement robust data validation using Pydantic models
- ✅ Create consistent and informative API responses
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully with proper HTTP status codes
- ✅ Version your APIs for backward compatibility
- ✅ Structure your FastAPI projects for maintainability
- ✅ Write basic tests to ensure API reliability
- ✅ Apply security best practices in your API design

## Learning Path

This section follows a progressive learning approach:
1. **Conceptual Understanding**: Each topic starts with theory and best practices
2. **Practical Implementation**: Real-world examples and code snippets
3. **Common Patterns**: Industry-standard patterns and anti-patterns to avoid
4. **Hands-on Exercises**: Practice problems to reinforce your learning
