# Foundation

Welcome to the Foundation section! This guide builds upon the "Getting Started" guide and introduces more foundational concepts for building well-structured RESTful APIs with FastAPI.

## Overview

This section covers essential beginner topics that will help you create robust and well-designed APIs:

### [Executive Summary](/docs/foundation/executive-summary)
An introduction to the foundational concepts we'll be exploring in this guide.

### [Recap: Core Concepts](/docs/foundation/recap-core-concepts)
A quick refresher on URI design and HTTP methods before diving into new topics.

### [Data Validation with Pydantic Models](/docs/foundation/data-validation)
Learn how to use Pydantic models for data validation and serialization to ensure your API receives and sends data in the correct format.

### [Path and Query Parameters](/docs/foundation/parameters)
Master the use of path and query parameters with type hints and validation for filtering, sorting, and pagination.

### [Basic Error Handling](/docs/foundation/error-handling)
Implement proper error handling using HTTPException to return meaningful HTTP error responses.

### [Basic API Versioning](/docs/foundation/api-versioning)
Learn URL-based versioning strategies to manage different versions of your API.

### [Response Models](/docs/foundation/response-models)
Use response models to ensure security and predictability by controlling what data your API returns.

### [Next Steps](/docs/foundation/next-steps)
Find out where to go next to continue building more advanced and robust APIs.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this section, make sure you've completed the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide, which covers:
