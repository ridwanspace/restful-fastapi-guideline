# Installing FastAPI

Let's get your development environment set up so you can start building APIs! This guide will walk you through installing Python, setting up a virtual environment, and installing FastAPI.

## Step 1: Check Your Python Version

FastAPI requires **Python 3.8 or higher**. Let's check what you have:

**Open your terminal or command prompt** and run:

```bash
python --version
```

If that doesn't work, try:
```bash
python3 --version
```

**You should see something like:**
```
Python 3.9.7
```

### If Python is Not Installed

**Windows:**
1. Go to [python.org](https://python.org)
2. Download Python 3.11 or later
3. Run the installer and **check "Add Python to PATH"**

**macOS:**
```bash
# Using Homebrew (recommended)
brew install python

# Or download from python.org
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv
```

## Step 2: Create Your Project Folder

Create a new folder for your FastAPI project:

```bash
# Create and navigate to your project folder
mkdir my-first-api
cd my-first-api
```

## Step 3: Set Up a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment keeps your project dependencies separate from other Python projects. Think of it as a clean workspace for each project.

### Create the Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv fastapi-env
```

This creates a folder called `fastapi-env` containing your isolated Python environment.

### Activate the Virtual Environment

**On Windows:**
```bash
fastapi-env\Scripts\activate
```

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
source fastapi-env/bin/activate
```

**You'll know it worked when you see:**
```bash
(fastapi-env) your-username@computer:~/my-first-api$
```

The `(fastapi-env)` prefix shows you're in the virtual environment.

### Deactivating (For Later)

When you're done working, you can deactivate the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```

## Step 4: Install FastAPI and Uvicorn

With your virtual environment activated, install FastAPI and Uvicorn:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn[standard]
```

**What you're installing:**
- **FastAPI**: The web framework for building APIs
- **Uvicorn**: A fast ASGI server to run your FastAPI application
- **[standard]**: Includes extra features like automatic reload and better performance

**You should see output like:**
```
Collecting fastapi
Downloading fastapi-0.104.1-py3-none-any.whl
...
Successfully installed fastapi-0.104.1 uvicorn-0.24.0
```

## Step 5: Verify Your Installation

Let's create a simple test to make sure everything works!

### Create Your First API File

Create a file called `main.py` in your project folder:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

# Create the FastAPI application
app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy"}
```

### Run Your API

In your terminal (with the virtual environment activated), run:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

**Understanding the command:**
- `main`: The name of your Python file (main.py)
- `app`: The FastAPI instance inside main.py
- `--reload`: Automatically restarts when you change code (great for development!)

**You should see:**
```
INFO:     Started server process [12345]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### Test Your API

1. **Open your web browser** and go to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
   
   You should see:
   ```json
   {"message": "Hello World"}
   ```

2. **Try the health check endpoint**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health`
   
   You should see:
   ```json
   {"status": "healthy"}
   ```

3. **Check the automatic documentation**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
   
   This opens **Swagger UI** - an interactive interface where you can test your API!

4. **Alternative documentation**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`
   
   This shows **ReDoc** - a beautiful alternative documentation format.

## ðŸŽ‰ Success!

If you see the JSON responses and the documentation pages, congratulations! You've successfully:

âœ… Installed Python and FastAPI  
âœ… Set up a virtual environment  
âœ… Created your first API  
âœ… Learned how to run and test it  

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "python: command not found"
**Solution:** Python isn't installed or not in your PATH. Follow the Python installation steps above.

### Issue: "pip: command not found"
**Solution:** Try `python -m pip` instead of just `pip`.

### Issue: Virtual environment won't activate
**Solution:** Make sure you're in the right directory and using the correct command for your operating system.

### Issue: Port 8000 already in use
**Solution:** Either:
- Stop the other process using port 8000
- Use a different port: `uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001`

### Issue: Can't access http://127.0.0.1:8000
**Solution:** 
- Make sure Uvicorn is running (you should see "Uvicorn running on..." message)
- Try `http://localhost:8000` instead

## Development Tips

### 1. Keep Your Virtual Environment Active
Always activate your virtual environment before working on your FastAPI project:
```bash
source fastapi-env/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# or
fastapi-env\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

### 2. Use --reload for Development
The `--reload` flag automatically restarts your server when you change code - perfect for development!

### 3. Stop the Server
Press `Ctrl+C` (or `Cmd+C` on Mac) to stop the server.

### 4. Install Additional Packages
You can install more packages anytime:
```bash
pip install requests  # For making HTTP requests
pip install pytest    # For testing
```

## What's Next?

3. **Explore [HTTP Methods](/docs/01_getting-started/basic-http-methods)** - Master GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE

## Quick Reference

**Activate virtual environment:**
