# Installing FastAPI

This guide will walk you through installing FastAPI and an ASGI server, Uvicorn, which is recommended for running FastAPI applications in development and production.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system. You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version
# or
python3 --version
```

It's also highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies.

## Creating a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

1.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    Navigate to your project directory and run:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    This creates a `venv` folder in your project directory.

2.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    -   On **macOS and Linux**:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    -   On **Windows**:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    Your terminal prompt should now indicate that you are in the virtual environment.

## Installing FastAPI and Uvicorn

With your virtual environment activated (or if you choose to install globally), you can install FastAPI and Uvicorn using pip:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn[standard]
```

-   `fastapi`: This installs the FastAPI framework itself.
-   `uvicorn[standard]`: This installs Uvicorn, an ASGI server. The `[standard]` option includes `python-multipart` for form data parsing and `uvloop` for better performance (on Unix-like systems). If you only need the basic Uvicorn, you can use `pip install uvicorn`.

## Verifying the Installation

To quickly verify your installation, you can create a simple FastAPI application.

1.  Create a file named `main.py`:

    ```python
    from fastapi import FastAPI

    app = FastAPI()

    @app.get("/")
    async def root():
        return {"message": "Hello World"}
    ```

2.  Run the application with Uvicorn:

    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    -   `main`: refers to the `main.py` file.
    -   `app`: refers to the `app = FastAPI()` instance created in `main.py`.
    -   `--reload`: makes the server restart after code changes. Only use this for development.

3.  Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You should see the JSON response:
    ```json
    {"message": "Hello World"}
    ```

You should also be able to see the interactive API documentation (provided by Swagger UI) at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` and alternative documentation (provided by ReDoc) at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed FastAPI and Uvicorn. You are now ready to start building your APIs.
