# ðŸš€ Getting Started with RESTful APIs and FastAPI

Welcome to your journey into building web APIs! Whether you're new to APIs or new to FastAPI, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know to build your first RESTful API.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this section, you'll understand:
- What APIs are and why they're important
- How to set up FastAPI in your development environment
- The fundamentals of RESTful API design
- How to build your first working API with real examples

## Prerequisites

You should have:
- **Basic Python knowledge**: Variables, functions, classes, and basic data types
- **Python 3.8+** installed on your system
- **A code editor** (VS Code, PyCharm, or any editor you prefer)

No prior API experience required! We'll start from the very beginning.

## Learning Path

Follow this sequence for the best learning experience:

### 1. [What is REST & HTTP APIs](/docs/01_getting-started/a-start-what-is-restapi)
Start here to understand what APIs and REST are all about, then master the standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with practical FastAPI examples and real-world use cases.

### 2. [Basic HTTP Methods](/docs/01_getting-started/basic-http-methods)
Learn the core HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with hands-on FastAPI examples and understand when to use each method.

### 3. [Basic URI Design & Naming](/docs/01_getting-started/basic-uri-design)
Learn the fundamentals of designing clean, predictable API endpoints that other developers will love to use.

### 4. [Installing FastAPI](/docs/01_getting-started/installation)
Get your development environment ready. We'll install FastAPI, set up a virtual environment, and verify everything works with a simple "Hello World" API.

### 5. [Your First Complete API](/docs/01_getting-started/your-first-api)
Build a complete, working API step-by-step. You'll create endpoints, handle different types of requests, and see your API in action.

## What's Next?

After completing this getting-started guide, you'll be ready to dive into the **[Foundation](/docs/02_foundation)** section, where you'll learn advanced concepts like data validation, error handling, and testing.
